<p>Boris didn’t get the support he thought would, That’s why he didn’t stand. <br>
<br>
Suspected this when Rushi Sunak declared his bid today. He wouldn’t have done that if he was not confident Boris *didn’t* have the support. <br>
<br>
So Sunak is PM.<br>
<br>
It’ll still be a Tory clusterfuck.</p>
