<p>The nearest I can think of is in classic 80s Who when they introduced Turlough who, whilst presenting as a standard companion, was secretly trying to kill The Doctor. He eventually redeemed himself tho. “Mawdryn Undead” is the intro story. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawdryn_Undead?wprov=sfti1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawdryn_Undead?wprov=sfti1</a></p>
