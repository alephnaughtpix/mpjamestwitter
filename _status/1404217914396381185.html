<p>&amp;, UK edit from the 12" is bonkers. Lots of UK single edits of dance tunes from 1988 era are bonkers,like they're try to edit club tunes into 1980s pop.Even at the time, could tell the single edit of "Rok Da House" was viciously edited from a larger tune. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHTfrgz3iZA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHTfrgz3iZA</a></p>
