<p>This store is where I got My Bloody Valentine's "Tremelo EP" a day or two after hearing it on John Peel's radio show. It was a *pre-release promo*! It sounded great, and the packaging looked better than the eventual release. :) I still have it, and still play it. <a href="https://twitter.com/FOPPofficial/status/1093931392633851904">https://twitter.com/FOPPofficial/status/1093931392633851904</a></p>
