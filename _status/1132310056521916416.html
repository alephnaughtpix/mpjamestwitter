<p>So, I'm in @CategoryIsBooks, looking through issue of "Lock Up Your Daughters" zine from 2010, as it has a feature on @TGKW, who was an inspiration in my photography. In same issue: feature on @ladymunter. Photo looks familiar. Then I look at the image credits... <br><img src="{{ "/media/1132310056521916416-D7bF_HwX4AEtHbT.jpg" | relative_url }}"/><br><img src="{{ "/media/1132310056521916416-D7bF_HvWkAA2EqF.jpg" | relative_url }}"/><br><img src="{{ "/media/1132310056521916416-D7bF_H1XsAAEBIx.jpg" | relative_url }}"/></p>
