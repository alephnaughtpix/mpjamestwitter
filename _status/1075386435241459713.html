<p>For me, it's Malcom McClaren's "Duck Rock", especially the lead-off single "Buffalo Gals" (Done with the World Famous Supreme Team). I suspect the video might have blown a few million minds in the UK when it was show on "Top of the Pops"... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN0uRg71bVY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN0uRg71bVY</a></p>
