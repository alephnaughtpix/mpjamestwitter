<p>Rather odd behavior by @MardiGla this morning, sharing a lawyer's letter from @prideglasgow on social media as evidence that PG is wanting to shut MG down. But the letter doesn't *actually say that*. <br>

Compare the statement here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mardigla/posts/377115609679401?__tn__=K-R">https://www.facebook.com/mardigla/posts/377115609679401?__tn__=K-R</a> with the letter (below). <br><img src="{{ "/media/1124277713559281665-D5o8npEWwAAFczt.jpg" | relative_url }}"/></p>
