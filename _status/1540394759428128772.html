<p>I’m loving all these “supermarket” analogies I’m seeing in the replies. <br>
<br>
Humans steal fish from a supermarket called “The Sea”, put them into *their* supermarket, called “A Net”: <br>
- Oh no! No stealing- we just *caught* it, it’s *ours*.<br>
<br>
Shark steals from “A Net”:<br>
- YOU THEIF!!!!</p>
